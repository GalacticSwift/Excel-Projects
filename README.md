I took a crash course and took roughly 2 to 3 weeks learning and applying the different advanced Excel concepts and functions that are commonly used now, learning what they do and how they help make an impact in real-world scenarios.

I learnt Excel functions such as Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Power Query and Power Pivot, after which I tried creating a sales dashboard of a fictitious clothing company using messy dummy data worth of 8000+ transactions.

Skills I applied :

• Appended and cleaned up 4000+ messy sales transactions with Power Query.
• Utilised PivotTables and PivotCharts to filter the best-selling clothes of each quarter and the most common payment method to dissect and analyse consumer data for important data-driven findings.
